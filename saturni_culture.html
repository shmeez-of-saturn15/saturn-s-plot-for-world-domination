	<h2>The Asteroid Trials</h2>
	<p>Saturni do not have a set age of legal adulthood. Biologically, we reach maturity at 22 Saturn years, or 638 Earth years, but to become an adult, one must complete the Asteroid Trials.These trials can be completed at any age, though the most common is from 14-22 Saturn years. To pass the Asteroid Trials, one must navigate the Kuiper Belt to reach a Saturni spacestation. Upon reaching the station, which aproximately translates to "Deepspace" in the english language, young Saturni are tested in wit and space combat, amongst other things. Should one fail the Asteroid Trials, they may retake them in one Saturn year.
