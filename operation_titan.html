	<hr>
	<h2>MISSION PARAMETERS</h2>
	<p>Send operatives Y-O-U & M-THEN-E to infiltrate Earth. Objectives necessitate total integration into Earthen society, lest humans notice and attempt to retaliate. Utilize shapeshifting devices to disguise operatives. Remember that homo sapiens enjoy sarcasm, war, and destroying the environment.
	<h2>MISSION REPORT 1</h2>
	<p>Integration successful. Have infiltrated human society. Goals: complete Earthen schooling -> gain documents required to join governmenting body -> take over Earth.
	<h2>MISSION REPORT 2</h2>
	<p>Accidentally let slip that operatives are clearly identical twin sisters. Thankfully, humans believe this to be a farce. Earthen intelligence indicates that we must turn this into a 'running joke' to maintain cover.</p>
	<h2>MISSION REPORT 3</h2>
	<p>Designation: Small Human Friend mentioned that humans are polar bears. Operatives initially displayed confusion--intelligence indicates that polar bears are fluffy white mammals that live on an icy continent--but changed response to agreement in order to maintain cover.</p>
	<h2>MISSION REPORT 4</h2>

		id="polar_bear_image"/>
	<p>We have realized that Small Human Friend may have been utilizing human sarcasm, an idea mentioned in the initial mission parameters. Mission Progress: just over one Earthen month until completion of middle school education. Operatives intend to complete high school education in seperate locations in order to gain more information, having already cemented human identities. Lastly, operative Y-O-U has created a website utilizing Earthen technology intending to inform humans of Saturni culture for the eventual takeover under the pretense of a joke. Operatives have gained skills in human humor. Sincerely, - Polar Bear</p>
